		<h1>Persona</h1>

		<img src="img/Carlos Persona.jpg" alt="Carlos" height="30%" width="30%">

		<p><b>Name</b>: Carlos Contreas</p>

		<p><b>Age</b>: 33 </p>

		<p><b>Profession</b> Full time tax auditor for the city of Albuquerque.  He recently received an unexpected bonus and has decided to use it to purchase more memorabilia to add to his collection.</p>

		<p><b>Technology</b>: Macbook pro 15" laptop with retina display, iPhone 5 and a 30" hi-def Samsung television at home. Broadband internet through the devil aka Comcast</p>

		<p><b>Attitudes and Behaviors</b>: He is an avid collector who searches far and wide, both on line and the real world, to finish his collection of original 1970's star wars action figures.  He scours sites like eBay almost daily to find missing items in the collection.  He even goes so far as to keep checking his phone, even during meetings at work, when certain auctions were getting close to their end.  His fandom penetrates every corner of his life.  He has Star Wars socks, Star Wars sheets on his bed, Darth Vader bath soap and he even had a Star Wars theme wedding with his bride wearing the iconic Leia buns.</p>

		<p><b>Needs and Frustrations</b>: He is looking to buy original Star Wars memorabilia that is missing from his collection.  He enjoys the convenience of bidding online because it is hard to find a lot of the original merchandise he is looking for here in Albuquerque. He has bid on several online auctions and has used ebay for several of his memorabilia purchases. He has been to several live auctions in person, but he is new to "live" online auctions. He is intrigued by the original Star Wars props that are for sale in an upcoming eBay Live auction. While it is convenient to bid online, he hates when he loses an auction because he was busy and couldn't up his bid in time. He hopes that "live" eBay auctions will eliminate this problem because he will be watching it happen "live".</p>

		<h2>Use Case</h2>

			<p>Carlos has been looking for original production props to elevate his top of the line collection, so he searches for Star Wars on eBay.  He notices that in a few days there is going to be an auction of original Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back props and memorabilia.  He is really excited and even takes the day off of work so he can pay attention to the auction without any distractions.  He is determined to win a number of long sought after items and hoping to get one or two BIG purchases.</p>

			<p>The day of the auction arrives and Carlos gets everything ready for bidding.  He boots up his laptop, registers for the auction, grabs a cup of coffee and waits in anticipation for the auction to begin.</p>

			<p>He bids on the lots he wishes to purchase, winning a few small items that don't go for much, but his eyes are on the prop of the hand of Luke Skywalker which was cut off by Darth Vader in the movie.  He watches as the price goes up and up.  He re-bids and re-bids and it's clear he's in a bidding war with another customer for the prop. In the end he wins the auction and now he just has to figure out how to tell his wife that he drained the bank account because he forgot the sellers premium fee and spent a lot more than he meant to.</p>
